quick experiment with a web terminal and snake game

## what it is

messing around with web terminals

## how to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

or just open index.html in a browser

## commands

- `help` - see what works
- `snake` - play snake 
- `clear` - clear screen
- `about` - random info

## controls

arrow keys to move snake, esc to quit

that's pretty much it lol

## todo maybe

- add more games 
- make it less janky
